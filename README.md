# PADME
The name PADME stands for "Protein And Drug Molecule interaction prEdiction". This is the repository containing the source code for my Master's thesis research, about predicting drug-target interaction using Deep Neural Networks. 

It currently depends on a version of DeepChem Python package released in November 2017. I will need to make major modifications to it such that it would be compatible with the current version of DeepChem.
